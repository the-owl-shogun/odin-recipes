    <h1>Odin Recipes</h1>
    <p>This simple website is inspired by <strong>THE ODIN PROJECT.</strong> The project is meant to test my knowledge of HTML (and eventually CSS). Below will be three links each featuring an individual recipe of foods I like. Click through each of them and enjoy the recipes!</p>
